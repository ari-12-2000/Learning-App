It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall appearance of web pages.

## Types of CSS

1. **Inline CSS** – style added directly to HTML elements using the `style` attribute.
2. **Internal CSS** – defined inside a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section.
3. **External CSS** – linked through a `.css` file using the `<link>` tag.
